# LoreKeeper
Lore Keeper is a hybrid narrative engine that combines Ink scripting with a large language model (LLM) game master. Writers craft branching stories in Ink, while the AI interprets player input, manages dialogue, and sends commands to the C# Ink runtime â€” creating immersive, responsive narrative games with minimal code.
