== main ==
You wake up in your apartment. The air smells faintly of solder, and there's a tangle of jumper wires on the table next to your keyboard.

* [Check your overnight GitHub notifications]
    You scroll through issues. Someone filed a bug report on a function you knew would break. You sigh.
    -> main

+ [Make coffee and stare at the sunlight]
    The light is too bright. You close the blinds halfway and start thinking about what multiplication really is.
    -> afternoon

* [Boot up LoreKeeper project]
    The terminal blinks, waiting for input. The last thing you typed was a half-finished function to route narrative control to the LLM.
    -> dev_loop

== dev_loop ==
You open your Ink file. It's still not quite behaving.

* [Try to run it]
    > INK ERROR: ran out of content. Do you need a 'Done' or 'end'?
    You close your eyes. "We *did* add DONE. We *did*."
    -> philosophy_check

* [Refactor the C# routing layer]
    You fix a bug, recompile, run, and watch the system crash on a null reference.
    You smile slightly. “Good. It’s failing for the right reason.”
    -> philosophy_check

== philosophy_check ==
You lean back in your chair.

* [Think about what Ink really is]
    “It’s a virtual machine for story logic... but it lacks structural introspection. Maybe I should build a validator.”
    -> main

- [Wonder why the world doesn’t make clean systems]
    You think about all the people who never ask *why* something is designed the way it is.
    Then you realize you haven’t eaten.
    -> main

-> lunch

== lunch ==
You open your fridge. There’s cold pizza, a few eggs, and a datasheet for a DC-DC converter.

* [Eat pizza and reread the datasheet]
    It has a weird note about transient voltage behavior. You make a mental note to scope it later.
    -> afternoon

* [Make eggs and stare at the wall]
    You start composing a critique of academia in your head, but get distracted by a sudden idea about how to express “power” as a geometric relationship.

-> afternoon

== afternoon ==
You’re back at your keyboard. The sun is lower now.

+ [Write code]
    It compiles. You pause. No runtime errors. That’s suspicious.
    -> main

* [Write a new knot in Ink]
    You call it `== define_power ==` and get halfway through before thinking, “This is just a vector field with emotional charge.”
    -> afternoon

-> DONE
